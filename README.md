- Comment code as you go, this will make life easier for somebody that steps into a project you have been working on.
- If you are editing somebody elseâ€™s code, follow the same style/syntax and try to avoid cleaning somebody elseâ€™s code. Edit lines relevant to your task for a simpler git merge. Refactoring is a separate job.
